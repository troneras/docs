## Access your server using SSH

You can securely access your server using SSH. Your ssh connection will be protected by Cloudflare Access, and tunneled through Cloudflare Tunnel.
This means that your server doesn't need to expose any open port to the internet.

Run the following command to access your server:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@ssh.yourdomain.com
```

If you want to use a different ssh key, you can specify the key with the `-i` flag:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@ssh.yourdomain.com
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble connecting to your server, is possible that the public key was not added to the `terraform/config/ssh/public_keys` list.
To add a new key, update the `terraform/config/ssh/public_keys` list with the new key.

And run the installer `./selfhoster --apply` in the root of the project.

- Second option is to access the server from AWS console. You can access the server from the AWS console by navigating to the EC2 instance and clicking on the `Connect` button.
- Third, and last resort option, is to set `allow_ssh    = true` in the `variables.auto.tfvars` file, and run `./selfhoster --apply`. This will open the port 22 to the internet, and you will be able to access the server using the public IP address.
(Not recommended, but still an option if you are having trouble accessing the server)
