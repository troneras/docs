## Add a new subdomain

Update the `variables.auto.tfvars` file with the new subdomain you want to add.

**Example: Add a new subdomain `htop` to your domain.**

1. Update the `variables.auto.tfvars` file with the new subdomain.
   In this example I create the mapping adding the new subdomain `htop` to the `cloudflare_records` list.
   Also, because I want this subdomain to be protected by Cloudflare Access, I add a new entry to the `cloudflare_access_applications` list.

```hcl
# The map of record to service running in the instance
cloudflare_records = [
  { name = "htop", service = "http://glances:61208" }, // add this
  { name = "@", service = "http://selfhoster:3000" },
  { name = "www", service = "http://selfhoster:3000" }
]
## The domains that should request your email for access
cloudflare_access_applications = [
  { name = "Access application for monitoring", domain = "htop" }, // add this
  { name = "Access application for root domain", domain = "@" },
  { name = "Access application for www", domain = "www" },
]
```

2. Run the installer `./selfhoster --apply` in the root of the project.

You should be able to access the new subdomain at the following URL: `https://htop.yourdomain.com`
