In your `variables.auto.tfvars` file, you can set the `email_aliases` variable to create new email addresses for your domain.

```hcl
emails = {
  send_only     = ["no-reply@example.com"]
  send_receive  = ["support@example.com", "info@example.com"]
  forward_email = "youremail@gmail.com"
}
```

- **send_only**: These emails are supposed to send emails only. The first one in this list should be used as the sender email in your mailing list to avoid spam filters.
  A SNS topic will be created for the bounces and complaints of this email. Listmonk will subscribe to this topic to handle the bounces and complaints.
- **send_receive**: These emails can send and receive emails. You can use these emails to receive emails from your customers.
- **forward_email**: All the emails received `*@yourdomain.com` will be forwarded to this account. You can use this email to receive all the emails sent to your domain and answer
  with any of your custom domain emails.

If you add more emails, run the installer `go run selfhoster.go --apply` in the root of the project. This operation is idempotent, so you can run it multiple times without any issues.
