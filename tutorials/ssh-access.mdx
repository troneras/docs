If you are using Coolify, you could very well never need to access your server directly. But if you need to, you can do it securely using SSH.

## Access your server using SSH

You can securely access your server using SSH. Your ssh connection will be protected by Cloudflare Access, and tunneled through Cloudflare Tunnel.
This means that your server doesn't need to expose any open port to the internet.

Run the following command to access your server:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@ssh.yourdomain.com
```

If you want to use a different ssh key, you can specify the key with the `-i` flag:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@ssh.yourdomain.com
```

## Adding more public keys

Once your instance is running, to add more public_keys to the server, ssh to the server and add the new public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

## Troubleshooting

### Hanging forever when connecting

Make sure that you've installed cloudflared and that you added in `~/.ssh/config` the following:

```bash
Host ssh.yourdomain.com
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # or the path to your generated private key pair
  ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
```

### You forgot to add your public key

You will need to add your public key to `terraform/config/ssh/public_keys` and run the installer `go run selfhoster.go --apply` in the root of the project. This will recreate the EC2 instance with the new public key.

### Can't connect to the server

If you are having trouble connecting to your server, is possible that the public key was not added to the `terraform/config/ssh/public_keys` list.
To add a new key, update the `terraform/config/ssh/public_keys` list with the new key.

And run the installer `go run selfhoster.go --apply` in the root of the project.

- Last resort option, is to set `allow_ssh = true` in the `variables.auto.tfvars` file, and run `go run selfhoster --apply`. This will open the port 22 to the internet, and you will be able to access the server using the public IP address.
  (Not recommended, but still an option if you are having trouble accessing the server)

<Warning>
  Adding new public_keys running apply will recreate the EC2 instance and you
  may loose anything that is not backed up
</Warning>
```
