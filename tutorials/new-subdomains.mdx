## Case A: Cloudflare access (This is what you probably want)

If you want to protect your subdomains with Cloudflare Access, you can add them to the `cloudflare_access_applications` list in the `variables.auto.tfvars` file.
For example, imagine that using Coolify you've deployed a service that is running on the subdomain `htop.yourdomain.com`. You can add this subdomain to the `cloudflare_access_applications` list to protect it with Cloudflare Access.

1. Update the `variables.auto.tfvars` file with the new subdomain to protect.

```hcl
cloudflare_access_applications = [
  { name = "Access application for monitoring", domain = "htop" }, // add this
  #...
]
```

2. Run the installer `go run selfhoster.go --apply` in the root of the project.

## Case B: Tunneling to services running directly on the instance

Update the `variables.auto.tfvars` file with the new subdomain you want to add.

**Example: Add a new subdomain `htop` to your domain.**

1. Update the `variables.auto.tfvars` file with the new subdomain.

This is how ssh works internally

```hcl
# The map of record to service running in the instance
cloudflare_records = [
  { name = "ssh", service = "http://<private_instance_ip>:22" },
  { name = "ping", service = "http://<private_instance_ip>:8080" }, # something running on the instance
  #...
]
## The domains that should request your email for access
cloudflare_access_applications = [
  { name = "Access application for monitoring", domain = "ssh" },
  { name = "Access application for ping", domain = "ping" }, # something you want to protect
  #...
]
```

2. Run the installer `go run selfhoster.go --apply` in the root of the project.

You should be able to access the new subdomain at the following URL: `https://htop.yourdomain.com`
