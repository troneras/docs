## Protect your domain with Cloudflare

Once you've published all your services, you might want to protect your domain from DDoS attacks, and other security threats. Cloudflare is a great service that can help you with that.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have already deployed your services and they are
  accessible at `https://yourdomain.com`. or `https://subdomain.yourdomain.com`.

Don't proceed with this guide if you haven't deployed your services yet.

</Note>

### 1. Update config

In your `variables.auto.tfvars` set **enable_cloudflare_proxy** to `true`.

```hcl
enable_cloudflare_proxy=true
```

### 2. Run the installer

Run the installer `go run selfhoster.go --apply` in the root of the project.

### 3. Verify your domain

Verify that you can still access your services at `https://yourdomain.com` or `https://subdomain.yourdomain.com`.
In Cloudflare DNS records, you can see the orange cloud icon next to your domain, which means that the traffic is being proxied through Cloudflare.
