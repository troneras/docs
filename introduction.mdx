Here's a quick overview on how to get everything deployed.

Once you're done, start with [this tutorial]() to get your first service up and running in minutes.
Let's deploy it!

## Prerequisites

Follow this steps to get everything ready for the deployment.

1. A Cloudflare account. The free tier is sufficient, but you need to [enable R2 and Access]() for the selfhoster.pro to work.
   Make sure you have the following information:
   - A domain name managed by Cloudflare
   - **clean up the default DNS records** (Cloudflare Zone dashboard > DNS > Delete all default A, CNAME and MX, records)
   - Your Cloudflare email, **Zone ID** and **Account ID**
   - Create a Cloudflare [API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) (Use template "Create Additional Tokens")
   - **Enable R2** (R2 > Choose free tier > Add your billing information)
   - [Enable Access](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) (Choose free tier > Add your billing information)
2. An AWS account. You need to create an Access Key and Secret Key for the selfhoster.pro to work with **AdministratorAccess**.
   Make sure you have the following information:

   - Your **AWS Access Key**
   - Your **AWS Secret Key**
   - Your **AWS Region** (e.g. eu-west-1)

3. Your local environment setup:
   - [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
   - [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
   - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) (Run `aws configure` to set up your AWS credentials)
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   - [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation)

<Warning>
  Make sure you've cleaned up DNS records and enabled R2 and Access in
  Cloudflare, and that you ran `aws configure` before proceeding
</Warning>

## Launching Coolify

### 1. Generate a Cloudflare token

In your terminal, run the following commands **one by one**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/troneras/selfhoster-pro.git
cd selfhoster-pro/create-token
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="API_TOKEN_FROM_BEFORE"
go run create_token.go
```

<Note>
  You've just created a new token for your Cloudflare account. Save it somewhere
  safe, you will need it later
</Note>

Go now to the terraform directory:

```bash
cd ../terraform
```

### 2. Configure the project.

**(1/4)** Fill in the `secrets.auto.tfvars` with your Cloudflare credentials and the token you just created.

```bash
mv secrets.auto.tfvars.example secrets.auto.tfvars
```

**(2/4)** Configure your project name and emails in `variables.auto.tfvars`. Follow the comments in the file to fill in the required information.

```bash
mv variables.auto.tfvars.example variables.auto.tfvars
```

**(3/4)** Add your public key or keys to `/config/public_keys`. You can add multiple keys, one per line.

<Note>
  You can use the one in your ssh folder `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or generate a new
  one with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C`
</Note>

**(4/4)** Add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
Host ssh.yourdomain.com
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # or the path to your generated private key pair
  ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
```

<Note>
  This will allow you to access the server with `ssh ssh.yourdomain.com`
</Note>

### 3. Deploy {" "} <Icon icon="rocket-launch" size={32} />

Run the following commands to deploy Coolify.

```bash
go run selfhoster.go --init --debug
```

<Tip>
  Sometimes the command fails if AWS can't verify your domain before attempting
  to create the new emails. Run again `go run selfhoster.go --apply` and it
  should solve the issue{" "}
</Tip>

After a couple of minutes, you will get some emails from AWS telling you that
your domain is verified, and then some more emails to confirm the email identities.

<Note>
  {" "}
  After the installer runs a new file (`credentials.txt`) will appear with your email
  SMTP and R2 bucket credentials
</Note>

  In 5 minutes, you will be able to access Coolify at
  `https://ops.yourdomain.com`.
