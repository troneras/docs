### Installer

The installer has been designed to make the setup process as easy as possible.

1. Position yourself in the root of the project.
2. Copy `./terraform/secrets.auto.tfvars.example` to `./terraform/secrets.auto.tfvars` and update the file with your credentials.

```bash
cp ./terraform/secrets.auto.tfvars.example ./terraform/secrets.auto.tfvars
echo "Edit this file with your credentials"
```

3. Copy `./terraform/variables.auto.tfvars.example` to `terraform/variables.auto.tfvars` and update the file with your project name. (Change project_name, and you can leave the defaults as they are)

```bash
cp ./terraform/variables.auto.tfvars.example ./terraform/variables.auto.tfvars
echo "Edit this file with your project name"
```

4. Run the installer `./selfhoster --start` and follow the instructions.

```bash
./selfhoster --start
```

> The installer will start a docker image, where it will run first aws configure to set up your credentials, and then it will run terraform to create the resources in your account.
