If for some reason the installer fails, first of all, check that you've followed the get started guide. If you have, then you can try the following steps:

1. Run the installer with the `--debug` flag to get more information about the error. This will help you understand what's going wrong.
2. If the error is related to the domain verification, run the installer again with the `--apply` flag. This will solve the issue.
3. If the installer fails to create the new emails, run the installer again with the `--apply` flag. This will solve the issue.
